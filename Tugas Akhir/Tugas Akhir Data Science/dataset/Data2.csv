3,riverhouse103,20-Mar,Earns high rating,My  boyfriend and I had two plant based burgers. We patiently waited about twenty minutes For the food (which we were very excited to try ). We were going to eat the food outside because it was a beautiful day but we decided to take...our food home instead. We when arrived home and began to eat our food we discovered the bread was ROCK hard .Not only was bread was rock hard it was enough onions to feed an entire family. We had high expectations for this place and were highly disappointed. Money was wasted (50 bucks to be exact) and  it was also about a twenty minute drive from home . We will not be going back again !!!More,Couples,Bareburger
