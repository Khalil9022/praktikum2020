5,raniandjames,20-Mar,"Excellent food, great service!","Came across this restaurant on trip advisor so thought we’d try it out. It did not disappoint! One of the best meals we had in NY! Was exactly what we were looking for. We had chipotle bbq wings which were some of the best wings...we’ve ever had, a burger which was also great and the garlic fries which were amazing! Everything was cooked well and tasted great! The restaurant is pretty small so probably best to book a table if you can - especially on weekends, also request a table towards the back as we sat very near the front door so was pretty cold. 

The food is a little expensive - a double cheese burger was $15 with no fries, but was worth it.

The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure everything was ok. Would definitely visit this place again next time we are in NYC!More",Couples,Black Iron Burger

The atmosphere is friendly, relaxed and really cosy. We were seated straight away even though we hadn’t booked and the service was attentive without being overbearing. Great choice of burgers and drinks and the fries are to...die for, we had 4 different lots between us and couldn’t decide which ones were the best as they were all fantastic!  I paid about $160 (the equivalent of £120) for 2 adults and 2 teenagers eating one burger and fries each plus 4 beers and 4 soft drinks and tip which we thought was quite reasonable considering we all really enjoyed the whole experience.
