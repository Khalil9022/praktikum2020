5,Jayne032,19-Dec,Amazing Burgers,"We took my mum and a friend here on our last visit to NYC - myself and my husband had been before, and liked it so much, we knew we had to reserve a table here for their visit.

The food is lovely, we all...had something different and we all enjoyed it. My mum isn't a massive burger fan, but she wanted to go to experience a burger in NYC - they offer a chicken burger and she said it was lovely.

Great decor, and lots of choices. The only thing not letting me give it 5/5 was that the music is a little loud for chatting over.

We'll be back!!More",Couples,
