9,The fries were great too.
10,A great touch.
11,Service was very prompt.
12,Would not go back.
13,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
14,"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"
15,I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.

27,#NAME?
28,"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."
29,"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."
30,The worst was the salmon sashimi.
31,"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."
32,This was like the final blow!
33,I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
34,"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
35,"Overall, I like this place a lot."
36,The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
37,Ample portions and good prices.
38,"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
39,My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
40,Service sucks.
41,The shrimp tender and moist.
42,There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
43,Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
44,"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."
45,"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."

55,The portion was huge!
56,"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."
57,The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
58,Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
59,"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."

70,A great way to finish a great.
71,"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."
72,The service was meh.
73,"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
74,"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
75,The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
76,2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
77,The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
78,Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
79,There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
80,Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
81,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
82,The turkey and roast beef were bland.
83,This place has it!
84,The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.

102,"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."
103,"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."

105,So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
106,"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"

122,Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
123,"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."
124,"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."
125,"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
126,Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
127,"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
128,I wouldn't return.
129,"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."
130,This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
131,Penne vodka excellent!
132,"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."

140,Don't do it!!!!
141,The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
142,My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
143,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
144,Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
145,The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
146,"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
147,"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
148,I give it 2 thumbs down
149,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
150,My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
151,This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
152,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
153,Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
154,Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!

163,Avoid at all cost!

167,So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
168,I've never been treated so bad.
169,Bacon is hella salty.
170,"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."
171,"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
172,The waitresses are very friendly.
173,"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"
174,Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
175,"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
176,The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
177,"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."
178,"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."
179,We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
180,"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
181,I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
182,I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
183,It was probably dirt.

187,Interesting decor.

191,Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
192,"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
193,"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."

209,"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous."
210,"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."
211,"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
212,My friend loved the salmon tartar.
213,Won't go back.
214,Extremely Tasty!
215,Waitress was good though!
216,Soggy and not good.
217,The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
218,Which are small and not worth the price.
219,"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"
220,The service was a bit lacking.
221,"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
222,Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
223,"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
224,I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
225,This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!

233,Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
234,"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."
235,"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
236,"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing)."
237,If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
238,"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."
239,Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
240,Now this dish was quite flavourful.
241,By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
242,"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
243,"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
244,-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
245,"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
246,Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.
247,The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
248,Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
249,Owner's are really great people.!
250,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
251,The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.

314,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
315,"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
316,"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
317,"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong."

360,This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
361,Pretty cool I would say.
362,Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
363,Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
364,"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."

371,"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable."
372,"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"

385,I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
386,This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
387,This is a disgrace.
388,Def coming back to bowl next time
389,"If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place."
390,I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
391,"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."
392,We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
393,Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
394,"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."
395,I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
396,Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
397,Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.

403,Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
404,Left very frustrated.
405,I'll definitely be in soon again.
406,Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
407,Service was fantastic.
408,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
409,I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.

414,Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
415,But now I was completely grossed out.
416,I really enjoyed eating here.
417,First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
418,"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."
419,From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
420,"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
421,"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
422,We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.

434,It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
435,definitely will come back here again.
436,I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
437,Wow very spicy but delicious.

439,I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
440,I'd love to go back.
441,"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch."
442,Nothing special.

444,"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!"
445,Will not be back.
446,Sauce was tasteless.
447,"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way."

479,We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
480,"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here."
481,Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
482,The selection of food was not the best.
483,Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
484,"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
485,They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
486,I dont think I will be back for a very long time.

522,first time there and might just be the last.

524,"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late."
525,And it was way to expensive.
526,"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."
527,This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
528,The bartender was also nice.

550,Nice ambiance.
551,I would recommend saving room for this!
552,I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
553,"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
554,"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"

557,All of the tapas dishes were delicious!

594,The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
595,I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
596,It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!

619,I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
620,Very disappointing!!!
621,The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
622,"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait."

624,Ambience is perfect.
625,Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.

743,Will not be back!
744,There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.

766,The block was amazing.

769,My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
770,Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
771,"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
772,"What did bother me, was the slow service."
773,The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
774,Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
775,These were so good we ordered them twice.
776,So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
777,My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
778,"Unfortunately, it was not good."
779,I had a pretty satifying experience.
780,Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
781,"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."

785,We will not be coming back.
786,"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."

788,"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
789,When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
790,Once your food arrives it's meh.
791,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
792,The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
793,"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
794,So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
795,"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
796,This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
797,Mediocre food.
798,Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
799,I'm super pissd.
800,And service was super friendly.
801,Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
802,This place was such a nice surprise!
803,They were golden-crispy and delicious.
804,"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
805,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
806,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
807,"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
808,"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
809,The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
810,The service was terrible though.
811,"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
812,It was packed!!
813,I can say that the desserts were yummy.
814,The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
815,It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
816,This place should honestly be blown up.

828,Very poor service.
829,No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.

881,The service was extremely slow.

886,Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.

897,The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
898,"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
899,"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
900,After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
901,The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
902,We won't be returning.
903,This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
904,I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
905,"Very, very sad."
906,"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
907,"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"

909,The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.

912,They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!

915,This place is disgusting!
916,"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."

919,"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."
920,"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."
921,It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
922,We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
923,Disappointing experience.
924,"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."

927,We won't be going back.
928,The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.

935,Probably not in a hurry to go back.

941,I was VERY disappointed!!
942,This place is horrible and way overpriced.
943,"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
944,It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
945,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
946,"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
947,Con: spotty service.
948,"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
949,But then they came back cold.
950,"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
951,The real disappointment was our waiter.
952,My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
953,The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
954,"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
955,If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
956,She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
957,After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
958,Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
959,It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
960,But I don't like it.
961,Hell no will I go back
962,We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
963,"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
964,I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
965,The ambiance isn't much better.
966,"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
967,The food wasn't good.
968,"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
969,What happened next was pretty....off putting.

971,Overpriced for what you are getting.
972,I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
973,"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
974,"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
975,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
976,Food was below average.
977,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
978,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
979,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
980,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
981,"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
982,It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
983,I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
984,The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
985,Spend your money and time some place else.
986,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
987,the presentation of the food was awful.
988,I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
989,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
990,Appetite instantly gone.
991,Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
992,"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
993,"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
